                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is <strong>Bavley Danial</strong>, I am an aspiring Graphics/Game Developer with 8 years of experience.<br>
                    I am studying Bachelors of Computer Science Advanced (Honours) and majoring in Games and Immersive Media at Monash University.
                    <p>
                        I've been deeply passionate about making games especially from the graphics side.
                        For me games are the highest form of art, and I regularly not just make them, but I enjoy them and love taking beautiful pictures of set pieces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have built all kinds of projects ranging from Computer Sciency ones like a custom programming language, to Game Dev projects like a Minecraft clone, a Flabby Bird Clone, a High-Speed FPS, and more, to Graphics Dev projects like Path-Tracing, OpenGL Rendering Engine, ASCII Post-Processing effect and more.

                <h1>My Journey</h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>NOTE: </strong>If you would like to see any of my projects check out the projects page, I go much more in depth into each project and show images of the progress of the ones that haven't been lost to time (I didn't know git when I was 13 ðŸ« ).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have started getting into programming when I was 13 years-old. I started like so many other peopole do learning Java to make Minecraft mods, but I got so fascinated by Computer Science that I started diving deaper and deaper into this spiral of computing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I threw away my Minecraft modding dreams to persue learning the basics of computers and how they work. I learned C and dove into memory and how it works, which eventually lead me to learn how games are made. I made simple games using C++ and SFML, and leveled up my understanding of what games are and how they're constructed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then started working with Unity, making small prototypes and messing around with stuff. I made a Flabby Bird clone, a Minecraft clone that you can see the ashes of here (I didn't know git at the time ;-;). I made a High-Speed FPS game with sliding, wall-running, grappling-hook and more. I made a small AmongUs replica that taught me how to handle multiplayer.<br>
                    My time was enjoyable but I wanted to learn more, specifically with graphics since my games have always looked... bad to say the least.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's when I started researching and using every tutorial/course there is in order to learn OpenGL. It was a wonderful experience and learning the difference between how GPUs
                    and CPUs worked was eye-opening. I was able to read any obj file, render it with diffuse and specular lighting, cast shadows, do cubemapped reflections. It was fun and it taught me so much. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I wanted to learn even more, so I started learning how to render in software. I made a Real-Time Software Path-Tracer which was so cool, I got to work with multithreading for the first time to make it faster, I then moved it to GPU (but still software based) to
                    add more features whilst having real-time performance.
